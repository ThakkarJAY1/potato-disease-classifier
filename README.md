# Potato Disease Classifier

Potato plants are susceptible to various diseases that can significantly impact their yield and quality. Identifying these diseases early is crucial for implementing appropriate control measures and minimizing crop losses. The Potato Disease Classifier is a deep learning model that aims to automate the disease identification process by accurately classifying different diseases affecting potato plants.

The classifier is trained using a diverse dataset of potato plant images, including healthy plants as well as those affected by various diseases. By analyzing patterns and features in the images, the model has learned to distinguish between different disease types, enabling accurate disease classification.
